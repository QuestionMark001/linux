# WHY FORK?

Given that _**Linus Torvalds**_ and _**Greg Kroah-Hartman**_ have removed lots of maintainers with `<.ru>` top-level domain emails and one maintainer with a Russian identity from the `MAINTAINERS` file,[^1] as well as publicly insulted and trampled on some builders of the open-source community.[^2] [^3]

To prevent such incidents in the future, I have decided to fork a copy of the Linux kernel source code for future needs.
